To play the game the 2 players take it in turns to move one of their checkers. Checkers can only move diagonally and can move 1 square forwards, either left or right. You may only move a checker into an empty space.<br><br>
To capture an opponent checkers you make a special move, where you jump over your opponents checker with one of your own. If an opponents checker is adjacent to one of your own, and there is an empty space behind it, you can jump your checker into the space behind. Your opponents checkers is then removed from the board.<br><br>
You must capture an opponents piece if it possible for you to do so! If after capturing a piece, there is another capture which the piece you just moved can make, then it must move again. You continue capturing until no more checkers are available for taking.<br><br>
You can promote a checker by reaching the other side of the board with it. If one of your checkers reaches the opposite side, it becomes a 'king'. You may then move this piece both backwards and forwards (giving a total of 4 available directions) making the piece more powerful and valuable.<br><br>
