- 45 cards are dealt to the layout.<br>
- There are 9 Columns. The 1st Column is dealt one card, the 2nd is dealt 2, 3rd 3, up to the 9th column which is dealt 9 cards. All cards are dealt face down except for the last card in each Column.<br>
- Cards from the Stock are flipped three at a time to a Discard Pile. When no cards remain in the Stock, the cards from the Discard Pile can be flipped over and gone through an unlimited number of times.<br>
- Only the top card of the Discard Pile may be played elsewhere. When a card from the Discard Pile is played then the new top card can also be played.<br>
- Foundations are built Up and In Suit starting with an Ace and continuing on to a King.<br>
- Columns are built Down in Alternating Color. For example, a red 6 may be placed on a black 7.<br>
- All face up cards in any Column can move to another Column as long as the build rule is followed.<br>
- The topmost card in any Column is available for play to either another Column or a Foundation.<br>
- When a face down card is the topmost card in a Column, it is flipped face up.<br>
- Empty Columns may be filled with any card or cards that may be validly moved.<br>
