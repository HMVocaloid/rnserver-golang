- All cards are dealt face up to the layout.<br>
- There are 8 Columns. The first four Columns are dealt 7 cards each and the second four Columns are dealt 6 cards each.<br>
- Foundations are built Up and In Suit starting with an Ace and ending with a King. For example, a 2 of Clubs can be placed on an Ace of Clubs, then a 3 of Clubs, then a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, up to the K of Clubs. The same holds true for the other suits.<br>
- Columns are built Down in Alternating Color. For example, a red 6 may be placed on a black 7. <br>
- The topmost card in any Column is available for movement to either another Column, a Foundation, or a Reserve (one of the free cells.)<br>
- Empty Columns may be filled with any card.<br>
- SolitaireNetwork's version of FreeCell supports a "Supermove" where you may move more than one card at a time as long as the move would have been possible by moving cards singly using Reserves or empty Columns to shuffle the cards around.<br>
- There are 4 Reserves available for play that are also known as free cells (upper left of window.) These begin the game empty and are used during play as placeholders for any single card.<br>
