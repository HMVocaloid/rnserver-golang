To get another card, click on "Hit," or press "Stand" when you are finished. Aces can be counted as either 1 point or 11 points. All Royal cards (Jack, Queen and King) are counted as 10 points.<br><br>
<font class=b>Rules</font><br><font class=black>Each player is dealt two cards, face up. The dealer is dealt two cards, one of them face up, the other face down. Players must play their hands first, and the dealer plays her hand last if there are player hands on the table that have not busted (exceeded 21 points).  Any hand over 21 points is called a "Bust".  The dealer must hit (take additional cards) until the her hand has a point value of 17 or higher.  If the player is dealt an Ace and a 10 card (a natural BlackJack), and the dealer does not have BlackJack, the player is immediately paid 1.5 times their bet (3 to 2).  This game also offers insurance if the dealer is showing an Ace.  It also allows Splits to play two hands, and Double Down to double the bet and get one more card.
