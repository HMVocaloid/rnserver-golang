<td colspan=3 class=black><br><p><font class=b>How to play</font><br>
Drop the gems one at a time into the playing area. A gem can be grouped with its neighbors to the left or right, or up and down (but not diagonally). Once a group of three or more gems is formed, it evaporates. Any gems that were above the group move down into the vacated spaces.<br><br>To drop the gems click on the column where you want to place it. Be quick, otherwise the gems get impatient and drop by themselves, wherever they happen to be. You can drop gems one right after another, without waiting for them to reach the bottom.<br><br>If you are close to running out of room, look for the Black Gem with a sparkle. This special gem will evaporate all of the gems identical to the one it lands on. If it doesn't land on a gem, it simply disappears.<br><br>
<font class=b>Special Options:</font><br><font class=black>
You can pause the game by pressing the P key on your keyboard. To resume your game press the P key again. You can also disable all sound using the S key, or just the music by pressing the M key. You can turn them back on using the same keys.<br><br>
<font class=b>Bonus Points:</font><br><font class=black>
The real trick to Gem Drop is to learn how to earn your bonus points. The points you can earn go up exponentially based on the number of gems in a single group, and by arranging "cascading" groups. A "cascade" is when one group is formed as the result of another group evaporating. Creating elaborate chain reactions to send your score through the roof.<br><br>One more hint, the white diamonds are worth the most points. Arrange a large group of white diamonds to group together on the second or third cascade for maximum points.<br><br>
