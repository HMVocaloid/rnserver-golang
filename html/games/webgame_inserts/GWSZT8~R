<font class=b>How To Play</font><br><font class=black>
- First, choose how much you want to bet. You can bet from $1 to $10 on a single Keno card. To make the maximum bet, you can click the Bet Max button. You can only win the jackpot if you make the maximum bet.<br>
- Next, choose the numbers you want to play. To win the jackpot, you must match 15 numbers, but you can choose as many or as few numbers as you like. You can also use the Quick 10 or Quick 15 buttons to have the computer randomly select numbers for you. The possible payouts are displayed on the right of the game, and the payouts are based on how many numbers you pick, and how much you bet.  When ready, click the Buy Ticket button, and watch the balls come out. 20 balls are drawn. The number you matched will be highlighted on the payout table to the right.<br>
Good Luck! Remember, this game is just for fun, no actual money is awarded.
