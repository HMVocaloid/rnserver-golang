- Ten Columns of cards are dealt 5 or 6 cards each. The first four Columns are dealt 6 cards, the next six Columns are dealt 5 cards each. All cards are dealt face down except fo the last card in each Column.<br>
- Every click on the Stock will deal one card to each Column. Click on the Stock after no more moves are possible (or desirable) in the layout. There are no re-deals.<br>
- Columns are built Down in Any Suit.<br>
- The topmost card of each Column is always available for play. Also, cards of the same suit and in sequence may be moved to another Column provided the above build rule applies. For example, an 8, 7, and 6 of Spades may move to any 9. However, an 8 of clubs, 7 and 6 of Spades may not move at all.<br>
- Sequences may not be split apart once formed except for the topmost card of any Column. For example, in a sequence of 8, 7, 6, the 7, 6 may not split apart from the 8 in order to be played to another 8.<br>
- When a sequence of King through Ace is formed within a Column, it is removed from the layout.<br>
- One point is scored for each card built within a Column starting with a King. For example, if a Column has a K, Q, and J of any suit in sequence then three points are scored for that combination. A full set of King through Ace is 13 points.<br>
- Empty Columns may be filled with any card or movable sequence of cards.<br>
