- The game begins with the cue ball in hand behind the head string. The break is legal when neither the cue ball nor the 8-ball is pocketed, and either one of the numbered balls is pocketed or one of them is driven to the rail.<br>
- If no numbered ball is pocketed by the opening break the table remains open (stripes/solids groups not decided yet) and the opposing player is next.<br>
- The choice of stripes or solids is determined when a player legally pockets a ball at open table.  After the groups are assigned the shooter must hit a ball of his group first and pocket any ball(s) of his group.<br>
- A player continues shooting until he fails to legally pocket a ball of his group, in which case the opposing player is next. When all balls of a player's group are pocketed then the 8-ball has to be pocketed in any pocket.<br>
- If a shot is a foul, the opposing player can place the cue ball anywhere on the table.  A foul occurs when either a) The cue ball does not hit a ball of the player's group first. b) The cue ball is pocketed. or c) None of the balls is driven to the rail.<br>
- A player loses when he pockets the 8-ball and not all of the balls of his group are pocketed or the hit is a foul.<br><br>
